## Prioritized work queue (do these in order)

> Note: this linear list is the active execution order. The Phase-based sections below are preserved as an archive and can be removed once the team adopts the linear queue.

- [ ] [1] Fix gateway â†” order-service endpoint mismatch
  - Decide canonical user-orders route (recommend: `/orders/me`).
  - Update handlers in `services/web-gateway/app/main.py` and audit `services/order-service/app/*` routes and tests.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Use a stable, semantic route for the current user's orders (e.g., `/orders/me`) to avoid ambiguity with parameterized `/{order_id}` routes. Update gateway to translate `/orders` -> upstream `/orders/me` when appropriate.
    - Tests: add unit tests in `web-gateway` verifying route translation and integration tests exercising registerâ†’loginâ†’create orderâ†’fetch orders to assert correct routing.
    - References: FastAPI route ordering and path parameter rules; include test that runs against `order-service` directly to ensure backward compatibility.

- [ ] [2] Enforce JWT secret & fail-fast on bad secret
  - Fail startup in `services/auth-service` if `JWT_SECRET` == "dev-secret" when `ENV` != development.
  - Add CI check to ensure `JWT_SECRET` is supplied for production builds.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Use a settings model (Pydantic BaseSettings) to validate presence and strength of `JWT_SECRET` at startup. If `ENV` is not `development` and the secret is missing, short, or a known "dev" value, exit with non-zero status and log an explicit error.
    - CI: add a pipeline job that runs the auth-service startup command with production env vars; the job must fail if `JWT_SECRET` is absent or insecure.
    - Tests: unit test that application startup raises SystemExit / fails when JWT_SECRET invalid and ENV=production.
    - References: Pydantic settings patterns (BaseSettings / ConfigDict), FastAPI startup validation guidance.

- [ ] [3] Harden auth cookie & CSRF strategy
  - Set cookie `secure=True` when TLS is present and tighten `SameSite` in `services/web-gateway/app/main.py`.
  - Choose CSRF strategy (double-submit token) or switch APIs to Authorization headers.
  - Add tests asserting cookie flags and CSRF protections.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Cookies: set `Secure=True` when running under TLS (detect via config or `X-Forwarded-Proto`), set `HttpOnly=True`, and use `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` for sensitive actions. Document behavior for local dev vs prod.
    - CSRF: prefer switching API endpoints to use Authorization headers (Bearer) for XHR/API calls; if HTML forms remain, implement double-submit CSRF token or synchronize token pattern and verify via tests.
    - Tests: automated tests that assert cookie attributes in responses (Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite) and CSRF token validation for admin POSTs.
    - References: FastAPI cookie handling, OWASP CSRF guidance, and browser cookie semantics.

- [ ] [4] Implement token revocation / improve logout semantics
  - Adopt refresh-token rotation or session store (Redis/Valkey) pattern.
  - Implement logout to revoke refresh tokens or mark sessions revoked; add tests.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Use refresh-token rotation or a session store (Valkey/Redis) to record active sessions and revoked tokens. On logout, mark the session revoked and ensure subsequent refresh attempts fail.
    - Tests: integration tests that perform refresh-token rotation and validate that rotated/revoked tokens are rejected; include concurrency scenario tests for race conditions.
    - References: OAuth2 refresh-token rotation patterns and session-store approaches (recommend documenting trade-offs in `todo.md`).

- [ ] [5] Replace broad `except Exception` usage and add observability
  - Replace bare catches with narrow exceptions; log structured errors and stack traces.
  - Add request ID middleware and include IDs in logs and inter-service headers.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Replace broad `except Exception` blocks with targeted exception handling and re-raise when appropriate. Ensure all exception handlers log structured error payloads (error message, stack, request id) using `structlog` configuration.
    - Observability: add a request-id middleware that injects `X-Request-ID` (generate if absent) and include it in logs and outbound service calls; add `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints (Prometheus client `make_asgi_app()` or equivalent) for each service.
    - Tests: unit tests that assert structured log entries contain `request_id` and that a 500 response still returns the request-id header; smoke test to scrape `/metrics` endpoint.
    - References: structlog production config (JSONRenderer), prometheus_client `make_asgi_app()`, and OpenTelemetry/span exemplar guidance.

- [ ] [6] Centralize token extraction/validation in web-gateway
  - Add a dependency/util to extract & validate tokens (cookie or header) and return claims.
  - Replace duplicated logic in `services/web-gateway/app/main.py` handlers.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Implement a FastAPI dependency (e.g., `get_current_user`) that checks Authorization header first, falls back to access_token cookie, validates signature/claims, and returns a typed Pydantic model with claims.
    - Tests: unit tests for the dependency covering header/cookie precedence, expired tokens, malformed tokens, and missing claims; integration tests asserting protected endpoints reject unauthenticated calls.
    - References: FastAPI dependency patterns for security (Depends, Security) and Pydantic for typed claim models.
  - Subtasks:
    - Add an explicit `/admin` auth guard in `web-gateway` that redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` (implement using the centralized `get_current_user` dependency).

- [ ] [7] Input validation & error handling
  - Replace manual casts with Pydantic models and return 400 on invalid inputs (e.g., quantity parsing).
  - Add unit tests for invalid inputs.

- [ ] [8] Response model & schema consistency
  - Ensure `/token` and other endpoints match declared `response_model` and add schema tests.

- [ ] [9] DB migrations + test infra
  - Add alembic (or equivalent) config for `auth-service` and `order-service` and initial migrations.
  - Add CI step to apply migrations to the test DB before integration tests.

- [ ] [10] Integration/e2e tests & CI job
  - Add integration tests that exercise gatewayâ†’authâ†’order flows using test DB and migrations.
  - Add a CI job to run the integration suite.

- [ ] [11] Server-side authorization enforcement
  - Ensure order-service performs role checks server-side (do not rely solely on gateway).

- [ ] [12] Structured logging, health, and metrics
  - Add health/readiness endpoints and basic /metrics
  - Add structured logs and standard request format for diagnostics.

- [ ] [13] Security hardening & scanning
  - Add Trivy CI job, harden bcrypt rounds config, verify JWT alg enforcement and key rotation plan.

- [ ] [14] Clean up tracker and CI hooks
  - Remove references to removed `update_tracker` script in CI/docs or update hooks to use `todo.md`.

- [ ] [15] Set up Valkey/session persistence and Docker Compose
  - Finish Valkey configuration for session management and ensure `docker-compose.mvp.yml` composes Valkey and Postgres reliably for local dev.
  - Notes & linkage:
    - Replace raw JWT cookie storage with Valkey-backed session tokens and a migration plan; this work depends on cookie hardening in [3] and token revocation/session strategies in [4].
    - Tests: add integration tests that verify login/logout flows with Valkey sessions and ensure refresh attempts for revoked sessions fail.

- [ ] [16] Configure service networking and discovery for local compose / test environments
  - Ensure services can address each other by service name; document required hostnames/ports for CI and dev.

- [ ] [17] Complete DB migrations & seed data rollout
  - Finalize alembic (or chosen tool) configs for `auth-service` and `order-service` and add initial migrations and seed fixtures for CI tests.

- [ ] [18] Configure pytest + coverage for all services
  - Add per-service pytest config and CI steps for auth-service, order-service, and web-gateway.

- [ ] [19] Add pre-commit and formatting enforcement to CI
  - Ensure Ruff/black/ruff configs are enforced on PRs and add a lint-fix job to CI.

- [ ] [20] Add Trivy container scan to CI
  - Block on HIGH/CRITICAL findings for demo images and document remediation steps.

- [ ] [21] E2E smoke test (headless, script-based)
  - Implement the registerâ†’loginâ†’create orderâ†’admin approve flow using `scripts/e2e_smoke.py` or a minimal requests-based script and add it to CI as a gated smoke test (optional offline flag for local runs).

- [ ] [22] Environment variable validation and secure dev secrets
  - Implement runtime validation for required env vars and provide secure dev defaults; document secret injection for CI/CD.

- [ ] [23] Configure structured logging (structlog) and request ID propagation across services
  - Standardize a JSON log format and add middleware to inject X-Request-ID headers for tracing between services.

- [ ] [24] Implement login rate limiting in auth-service
  - Prevent brute-force by blocking after 5 failed attempts / 60s per username; add unit tests.

- [ ] [25] Enforce bcrypt cost and JWT claim structure
  - Make bcrypt rounds configurable (default >=12) and enforce required JWT claims and algorithm policy.

- [ ] [26] Security verification tasks (Postâ€‘MVP)
  - Performance benchmark script and p95 goals
  - SQL injection / parameterized query verification and linters
  - Test coverage uplift plan and reporting
  - Documentation: curl examples and verification steps for reviewers

- [ ] [27] Clean up tracker & CI hooks
  - Remove references to removed `update_tracker` script or update automation to read `todo.md`.
