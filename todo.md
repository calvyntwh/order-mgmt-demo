## Prioritized work queue (do these in order)

> Note: this linear list is the active execution order. The Phase-based sections below are preserved as an archive and can be removed once the team adopts the linear queue.

- [x] [1] Fix gateway â†” order-service endpoint mismatch
  - Decide canonical user-orders route (recommend: `/orders/me`).
  - Update handlers in `services/web-gateway/app/main.py` and audit `services/order-service/app/*` routes and tests.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Use a stable, semantic route for the current user's orders (e.g., `/orders/me`) to avoid ambiguity with parameterized `/{order_id}` routes. Update gateway to translate `/orders` -> upstream `/orders/me` when appropriate.
    - Tests: add unit tests in `web-gateway` verifying route translation and integration tests exercising registerâ†’loginâ†’create orderâ†’fetch orders to assert correct routing.
    - References: FastAPI route ordering and path parameter rules; include test that runs against `order-service` directly to ensure backward compatibility.

    - Status: Done â€” gateway now translates `/orders` -> upstream `/orders/me`; unit tests added in `services/web-gateway` and an e2e smoke run created an order (note: `register` can return 400 if the test user already exists).

- [x] [2] Enforce JWT secret & fail-fast on bad secret
  - Fail startup in `services/auth-service` if `JWT_SECRET` == "dev-secret" when `ENV` != development.
  - Add CI check to ensure `JWT_SECRET` is supplied for production builds.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Use a settings model (Pydantic BaseSettings) to validate presence and strength of `JWT_SECRET` at startup. If `ENV` is not `development` and the secret is missing, short, or a known "dev" value, exit with non-zero status and log an explicit error.
    - CI: add a pipeline job that runs the auth-service startup command with production env vars; the job must fail if `JWT_SECRET` is absent or insecure.
    - Tests: unit test that application startup raises SystemExit / fails when JWT_SECRET invalid and ENV=production.

    - Status: Done â€” runtime validation implemented and unit test added.
      - Implementation: `services/auth-service/app/settings.py` (env-based settings with `validate()`); `services/auth-service/app/main.py` calls validation during startup.
      - Tests: `services/auth-service/tests/test_settings.py` verifies startup validation (raises SystemExit on insecure secret with `ENV=production`).
      - Note on Pydantic: the original acceptance note suggested `BaseSettings`; repository uses pydantic v2 where `BaseSettings` moved to `pydantic-settings`. To avoid adding that dependency and to keep tests deterministic, an environment/dataclass-based validator was implemented instead. If you prefer the Pydantic-based approach, I can switch to `pydantic-settings` in a follow-up.
      - CI check: Deferred â€” CI pipeline job to run auth-service startup in production-like envs has not been added yet and is recommended as the next step.
    - References: Pydantic settings patterns (BaseSettings / ConfigDict), FastAPI startup validation guidance.

- [x] [3] Harden auth cookie & CSRF strategy
  - Set cookie `secure=True` when TLS is present and tighten `SameSite` in `services/web-gateway/app/main.py`.
  - Choose CSRF strategy (double-submit token) or switch APIs to Authorization headers.
  - Add tests asserting cookie flags and CSRF protections.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Cookies: set `Secure=True` when running under TLS (detect via config or `X-Forwarded-Proto`), set `HttpOnly=True`, and use `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` for sensitive actions. Document behavior for local dev vs prod.
    - CSRF: prefer switching API endpoints to use Authorization headers (Bearer) for XHR/API calls; if HTML forms remain, implement double-submit CSRF token or synchronize token pattern and verify via tests.
    - Tests: automated tests that assert cookie attributes in responses (Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite) and CSRF token validation for admin POSTs.

    - Status: Done â€” cookie hardening and double-submit CSRF implemented and unit-tested.
      - Implementation: `services/web-gateway/app/main.py` â€” `_is_secure_cookie()` detects TLS/ENV and login sets `access_token` (HttpOnly) and `csrf_token` cookies; `_verify_csrf()` enforces double-submit token checks for cookie-based POSTs.
      - Tests: `services/web-gateway/tests/test_csrf_cookies.py` covers Secure/HttpOnly cookie flags (when `ENV=production`), rejection when CSRF token missing, and acceptance when cookie+form tokens match. Existing orders/admin routes remain covered by previous tests.
      - Notes: Tests produce minor DeprecationWarnings from Starlette/Jinja templating and per-request cookies; these are non-blocking but can be addressed in a separate cleanup task.
      - Next recommended step: Add CI integration to run these tests and add admin POST CSRF tests (approve/reject) to increase coverage. Consider centralizing token extraction (`get_current_user` dependency) as the follow-up task [6].
    - References: FastAPI cookie handling, OWASP CSRF guidance, and browser cookie semantics.

- [x] [4] Implement token revocation / improve logout semantics
   - Use Valkey as the persistent session store (Valkey-only per team decision).
   - Implement logout to revoke refresh tokens / mark sessions revoked; add tests.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Use Valkey to record active sessions and revoked tokens. On logout, mark the session revoked and ensure subsequent refresh attempts fail.
    - Tests: integration tests that perform refresh-token rotation and validate that rotated/revoked tokens are rejected; include concurrency scenario tests for race conditions (multi-process).
    - Implementation subtasks:
      - Add a pluggable `SessionStore` abstraction and a `ValkeySessionStore` implementation in `services/auth-service/app/session_store.py` (keep InMemory fallback for local tests).
      - Replace in-memory refresh store usage with the `SessionStore` factory; use Valkey when `VALKEY_URL` env var is present.
      - Implement atomic rotate/revoke operations using Valkey primitives (atomic server-side update or compare-and-swap API). If Valkey lacks a rotate primitive, implement a small server-side transaction or use Valkey's compare-and-swap semantics.
      - Add integration tests that run against a test Valkey (or an adapted test double) to verify rotation, revoke, and concurrency behaviors.
      - Add Valkey to the local `docker-compose` used by tests (or provide `docker-compose.test.yml`) and a pytest fixture to reset Valkey state between tests.
    - References: OAuth2 refresh-token rotation patterns and Valkey session-store approaches; document trade-offs in `todo.md` and `docs/REVOCATION.md`.
    - Status: Done â€” Valkey-backed session store implemented, gateway logout wired to revoke sessions, and integration tests (Valkey test-double + concurrency) added. Test results (local): auth-service: 13 passed; order-service: 6 passed; web-gateway: 10 passed.

- [x] [5] Replace broad `except Exception` usage and add observability
  - Replace bare catches with narrow exceptions where safe; ensure defensive/pragma'd handlers remain but log structured errors and stack traces.
  - Add request ID middleware and include IDs in logs and inter-service headers.
  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
  - Replace broad `except Exception` blocks with targeted exception handling where reasonable; preserve intentional defensive catches (many are marked `# pragma: no cover`) and ensure they log structured error payloads (error message, stack, request id) using `structlog` configuration.
  - Observability implemented: request-id middleware added (binds `X-Request-ID` into `request.state` and structlog contextvars), structured JSON logging (`structlog`) configured across services, and `X-Request-ID` forwarded on outbound calls. `/health` endpoints exist in services. Prometheus `/metrics` endpoints are intentionally deferred.
  - Tests: unit tests added/updated to assert `X-Request-ID` appears on responses and that structlog binding does not raise; auth/order/web-gateway test suites pass locally after these changes.
    - References: structlog production config (JSONRenderer), prometheus_client `make_asgi_app()`, and OpenTelemetry/span exemplar guidance.

- [x] [6] Centralize token extraction/validation in web-gateway
  - Add a dependency/util to extract & validate tokens (cookie or header) and return claims.
  - Replace duplicated logic in `services/web-gateway/app/main.py` handlers.

  - Notes & acceptance criteria (doc-backed):
    - Implement a FastAPI dependency (e.g., `get_current_user`) that checks Authorization header first, falls back to access_token cookie, validates signature/claims, and returns a typed Pydantic model with claims.
    - Tests: unit tests for the dependency covering header/cookie precedence, expired tokens, malformed tokens, and missing claims; integration tests asserting protected endpoints reject unauthenticated calls.
    - References: FastAPI dependency patterns for security (Depends, Security) and Pydantic for typed claim models.
  - Subtasks:
    - Add an explicit `/admin` auth guard in `web-gateway` that redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` (implement using the centralized `get_current_user` dependency).
    
  - Status: Done â€” implemented centralized helpers in `services/web-gateway/app/security.py` (`_extract_raw_token`, `get_current_user`, `get_current_user_optional`, `require_admin`, `build_auth_headers_from_request`) and updated gateway handlers (`app/main.py` and `app/routes.py`) to use them; request-id propagation added for outbound calls. Unit tests run locally: `auth-service` 16 passed, `order-service` 6 passed, `web-gateway` 13 passed.

- [x] [7] Input validation & error handling
  - Replace manual casts with Pydantic models and return 400 on invalid inputs (e.g., quantity parsing).
  - Add unit tests for invalid inputs.

  - Status: Done â€” Implemented Pydantic validation in `services/web-gateway/app/schemas.py`, updated `submit_order` in `services/web-gateway/app/main.py` to return 400 on invalid inputs, and added `services/web-gateway/tests/test_invalid_order_input.py`. Ran format/lint/tests locally; all service tests passed.

- [x] [8] Response model & schema consistency
  - Ensure `/token` and other endpoints match declared `response_model` and add schema tests.

  - Verification:
    - Added `services/auth-service/tests/test_token_schema.py` and `services/auth-service/tests/test_refresh_schema.py` which validate `/token` and `/refresh` responses against the declared `TokenWithRefresh` Pydantic model.
    - Ran auth-service tests: `18 passed` locally (includes the new schema tests).

- [ ] [9] DB migrations + test infra
  - Add alembic (or equivalent) config for `auth-service` and `order-service` and initial migrations.
  - Add CI step to apply migrations to the test DB before integration tests.
  - Decision for demo: DEFER full Alembic migrations for the MVP/demo.
    - Rationale: SQL initializers exist for a fast demo setup: `infra/postgres/init-auth.sql` and `infra/postgres/init-orders.sql`.
    - Action: keep SQL initializer files in `infra/postgres/` and add a later task to introduce Alembic if schema evolves post-demo.

- [ ] [10] Integration/e2e tests & CI job
  - Add integration tests that exercise gatewayâ†’authâ†’order flows using test DB and migrations.
  - Add a CI job to run the integration suite.

- [x] [11] Server-side authorization enforcement
   - Ensure order-service performs role checks server-side (do not rely solely on gateway).
   - Note: Implemented in `services/order-service/app/orders.py` (requires `get_current_user`/`require_admin` and per-endpoint checks).

- [-] [12] Structured logging, health, and metrics
   - Keep it minimal for the demo: add basic `/health` and consistent structured log lines now; defer Prometheus/OTel instrumentation.
   - Status: `/health` endpoint implemented in `web-gateway`, `auth-service`, and `order-service`; `/ready` and structured JSON logging (request-id propagation) remain TODO.
   - Actions:
     - Implement a lightweight `/health` (200 OK) and `/ready` endpoint in each service for the demo/runtime checks.
     - Standardize a simple structured log line format (JSON or key=value) and ensure critical handlers include service, level, message, and request_id.
     - Defer adding Prometheus `/metrics` endpoints and OTel tracing until postâ€‘MVP.

- [ ] [13] Security hardening & scanning
  - Scope for demo: defer full security scanning (Trivy) and heavy crypto hardening, but make minimal, low-risk improvements now.
  - Actions:
    - Make bcrypt rounds configurable via env var (default to a reasonable dev value, document recommended production >=12).
    - Add a short note to `todo.md` and service README sections documenting the required JWT algorithm (e.g., `HS256`) and rotation plan to be implemented postâ€‘MVP.
    - Defer adding Trivy CI job and full crypto hardening until after the demo.

- [ ] [14] Clean up tracker and CI hooks
  - Remove references to removed `update_tracker` script in CI/docs or update hooks to use `todo.md`.

- [ ] [15] Set up Valkey/session persistence and Docker Compose
  - Finish Valkey configuration for session management and ensure `docker-compose.mvp.yml` composes Valkey and Postgres reliably for local dev.
  - Notes & linkage:
    - Replace raw JWT cookie storage with Valkey-backed session tokens and a migration plan; this work depends on cookie hardening in [3] and token revocation/session strategies in [4].
    - Tests: add integration tests that verify login/logout flows with Valkey sessions and ensure refresh attempts for revoked sessions fail.

- [ ] [16] Configure service networking and discovery for local compose / test environments
  - Ensure services can address each other by service name; document required hostnames/ports for CI and dev.

- [ ] [17] Complete DB migrations & seed data rollout
  - Finalize alembic (or chosen tool) configs for `auth-service` and `order-service` and add initial migrations and seed fixtures for CI tests.

- [ ] [18] Configure pytest + coverage for all services
  - Add per-service pytest config and CI steps for auth-service, order-service, and web-gateway.

- [ ] [19] Add pre-commit and formatting enforcement to CI
  - Ensure Ruff/black/ruff configs are enforced on PRs and add a lint-fix job to CI.

- [ ] [20] Add Trivy container scan to CI
  - Block on HIGH/CRITICAL findings for demo images and document remediation steps.

- [ ] [21] E2E smoke test (headless, script-based)
  - Implement the registerâ†’loginâ†’create orderâ†’admin approve flow using `scripts/e2e_smoke.py` or a minimal requests-based script and add it to CI as a gated smoke test (optional offline flag for local runs).

- [ ] [22] Environment variable validation and secure dev secrets
  - Implement runtime validation for required env vars and provide secure dev defaults; document secret injection for CI/CD.

- [ ] [23] Configure structured logging (structlog) and request ID propagation across services
  - Standardize a JSON log format and add middleware to inject X-Request-ID headers for tracing between services.

- [ ] [24] Implement login rate limiting in auth-service
  - Prevent brute-force by blocking after 5 failed attempts / 60s per username; add unit tests.

- [ ] [25] Enforce bcrypt cost and JWT claim structure
  - Make bcrypt rounds configurable (default >=12) and enforce required JWT claims and algorithm policy.

- [ ] [26] Security verification tasks (Postâ€‘MVP)
  - Performance benchmark script and p95 goals
  - SQL injection / parameterized query verification and linters
  - Test coverage uplift plan and reporting
  - Documentation: curl examples and verification steps for reviewers
