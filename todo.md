# Order Management Demo - Task Tracker

## Project Overview

**Project**: Simple Order Management Demo App  
**Architecture**: 3-service microservices (Web Gateway, Auth Service, Order Service)  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks  
**Success Criteria**: Complete user journey in <60 seconds with <5 minute setup

## Build-up Approach (use this first)

Follow a "build-up" approach: complete all tasks tagged with [MVP] first. Treat untagged or [BACKLOG]/[EXTENDED] tasks as optional until the MVP is validated. For each completed [MVP] task, open a small PR, add a one-line description of verification steps, and update status.

Quick checklist to follow:

- Focus only on lines prefixed with [MVP].
- Run the local smoke test after finishing each service (auth -> orders -> gateway).
- Keep CI minimal: lint + smoke tests on PRs.
- After end-to-end happy-path works, iterate on BACKLOG items.

## Recent work (snapshot) â€” 2025-08-20

- Gateway: updated `services/web-gateway/app/main.py` to accept JSON or form-encoded POSTs for register/login/order flows; set HttpOnly `access_token` cookie on successful login; forward Authorization (from incoming header or cookie) when proxying to order-service; defensively handle non-JSON backend responses to avoid 500 crashes.
- Order-service: fixed route ordering in `services/order-service/app/orders.py` so `/orders/admin` is declared before parameterized `/{order_id}` routes to avoid "admin" being parsed as a UUID (422); the admin route was moved above parameterized routes and admin endpoints now respond correctly.
- Gateway: added a minimal Admin UI (`/admin`) and approve/reject form endpoints that proxy to order-service; added `admin.html` template and navigation link.
- Verification: rebuilt web-gateway, confirmed `/admin` returns HTML, and verified approve/reject flows via the gateway using an admin token â€” order status updates were observed in the database (APPROVED/REJECTED).

Notes & immediate follow-ups:

- Add an authentication guard for the gateway `/admin` page so unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`.
- Add CSRF protection for admin form POSTs (or migrate to XHR with CSRF token) to avoid accidental/forged admin actions.
- Harden cookies for production (set Secure flag when TLS present) and integrate Valkey-based session persistence instead of storing raw JWTs in cookies.
- Add a Playwright UI test that exercises registerâ†’loginâ†’create orderâ†’admin approve to prevent regressions.

Status: updates recorded and verified locally â€” [x] for the items above.
