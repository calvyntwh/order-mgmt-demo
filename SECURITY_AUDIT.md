# Security Audit: Secrets and Passwords Findings

This document summarizes the findings from scanning the order-mgmt-demo repository for hardcoded secrets, passwords, and other sensitive information.

## Scan Results Summary

**Total findings:** 12 issues (excluding test files)
- **4 HIGH severity** - Should be fixed immediately  
- **7 MEDIUM severity** - Review recommended
- **1 LOW severity** - Informational

## HIGH Severity Findings (Critical)

### 1. Hardcoded JWT Secret "dev-secret"

**Files affected:**
- `services/auth-service/app/auth.py` (lines 71, 236)
- `services/auth-service/app/settings.py` (lines 7, 29)

**Issue:** The application uses "dev-secret" as a fallback JWT secret when the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is not set.

**Risk:** In production, if environment variables aren't properly set, the application could use this weak default secret, allowing attackers to forge JWT tokens.

**Recommendation:** 
- ✅ **Already implemented:** The codebase has validation logic that prevents "dev-secret" from being used in production environments
- ✅ **Good practice:** Environment variable validation is enforced
- Consider removing the default entirely to force explicit configuration

## MEDIUM Severity Findings (Review Recommended)

### 2. Database URLs with Embedded Credentials

**Files affected:**
- `docker-compose.mvp.yml` (lines 37, 64)
- `scripts/validate_env.py` (line 112)  
- `.github/workflows/integration.yml` (line 74)

**Issue:** Database connection strings contain embedded usernames and passwords.

**Risk:** Low for development/CI, but credentials are visible in configuration files.

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Acceptable for development:** Using simple credentials for local PostgreSQL is standard
- ✅ **CI properly secured:** GitHub Actions uses repository secrets for sensitive credentials
- Consider using connection string templates with environment variable substitution

### 3. Weak Test Passwords

**Files affected:**
- `scripts/e2e_smoke.py` (lines 20, 44) - "password123", "adminpass123"
- `infra/postgres/seed-admin.sql` (line 2) - "adminpass123"

**Issue:** Predictable passwords used in test scenarios.

**Risk:** Low for testing, but could be problematic if these accounts exist in production-like environments.

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Acceptable for demos:** These are clearly marked as test/demo credentials
- Consider generating random passwords in smoke tests instead of hardcoded ones
- Ensure demo credentials are never used in production environments

## LOW Severity Findings (Informational)

### 4. Base64-Encoded Data

**Files affected:**
- `infra/postgres/seed-admin.sql` (line 9)

**Issue:** Base64-encoded string that appears to be a bcrypt password hash.

**Risk:** Very low - this is a properly hashed password for seeding test data.

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Acceptable:** This is a legitimate use case for seeding admin users in CI/testing

## Additional Findings (With Test Files)

When including test files in the scan, 7 additional findings were identified:

- 2 more "dev-secret" references in test files (acceptable for testing)
- 3 more weak test passwords in various test files (acceptable for testing)
- 2 more database URLs with embedded credentials in test files (acceptable for testing)

## Overall Security Assessment

### ✅ **GOOD Security Practices Found:**

1. **Proper Environment Variable Usage:** The application correctly uses environment variables for configuration
2. **Production Validation:** Settings validation prevents weak secrets in production
3. **GitHub Secrets Integration:** CI/CD pipelines properly use repository secrets
4. **Proper Gitignore:** `.env*` files are correctly excluded from version control
5. **Bcrypt Hashing:** Passwords are properly hashed using bcrypt
6. **JWT Implementation:** Proper JWT token handling with configurable algorithms

### ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Remove Default Fallbacks:** Consider removing "dev-secret" default entirely
2. **Test Password Generation:** Use randomly generated passwords in smoke tests
3. **Connection String Templates:** Use environment variable substitution for database URLs

## Remediation Priority

### Immediate (HIGH Priority)
- **No immediate action required** - The existing validation logic already prevents the identified high-severity issues from affecting production

### Medium Term (MEDIUM Priority)  
- Review test password usage and consider dynamic generation
- Evaluate database connection string patterns for better templating

### Long Term (LOW Priority)
- Consider implementing additional secrets management for enhanced security

## Tools and Scripts

The following tools have been created/updated to support ongoing security monitoring:

- **NEW:** `scripts/secrets_check.py` - Comprehensive secrets scanner
- **NEW:** `make secrets-check` - Quick secrets scan (excludes tests)  
- **NEW:** `make secrets-check-all` - Comprehensive scan (includes tests)
- **EXISTING:** `scripts/validate_env.py` - Environment validation
- **EXISTING:** `scripts/sql_safety_check.py` - SQL injection prevention

## Conclusion

The repository demonstrates **good overall security practices** with proper environment variable usage, validation logic, and CI/CD integration. The identified findings are primarily **low-risk development patterns** that are already protected by existing validation mechanisms.

The new secrets scanning tool provides ongoing monitoring capabilities to prevent future introduction of hardcoded secrets.
