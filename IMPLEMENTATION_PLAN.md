# Order Management Demo - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan breaks down the comprehensive PRD and Technical Specification into executable phases, with detailed tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. The project implements a 3-service microservices architecture showcasing modern Python development practices.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a Simple Order Management Demo App showcasing CaaS platform microservices capabilities
**Architecture**: 3-service microservices (Web Gateway, Auth Service, Order Service)
**Tech Stack**: Python 3.13, FastAPI, SQLModel, HTMX, Alpine.js, PostgreSQL, Valkey, UV package manager
**Success Criteria**: Complete user journey (register→order→admin approval) in <60 seconds with <5 minute setup

## Build-up Approach (use this first)

Follow a "build-up" approach: implement tasks tagged with [MVP] first to deliver the happy-path demo quickly. Treat untagged tasks as backlog or extended work. Suggested flow:
- Implement infra & repo skeleton [MVP]
- Implement Auth happy-path (user model, registration, login, admin bootstrap) [MVP]
- Implement Order happy-path (order model, create, list, admin approve/reject) [MVP]
- Implement minimal Web Gateway pages (register/login/create order/list/approve) [MVP]
- Add a single end-to-end smoke test and demo script [MVP]

For each completed [MVP] task: open a small PR with verification steps, run the local smoke test, and mark the task done. After the happy-path is working, iterate on BACKLOG/EXTENDED items.

## MVP (2-week) Scoped Plan — Happy-path Demo (OPTIONAL FAST-TRACK)

Purpose: provide a minimal, realistic plan to deliver a demo in ~2 weeks with 1–2 developers focusing strictly on the happy path. This is the recommended path when the goal is a stakeholder demo rather than production readiness.

Scope (in-scope):
- Core authentication: registration + login (OAuth2 password flow optional; simple token/session is acceptable)
- Order lifecycle: create → pending → approve/reject (minimal fields: item_name, quantity, notes)
- Simple role separation: user vs admin (admin created from env at startup)
- Single PostgreSQL instance, single schema; Valkey session store optional (can use in-memory session for fast-track)
- Minimal UI: plain Jinja2 templates with server-rendered forms (no HTMX required)

Out of scope for MVP (move to Backlog):
- Full security hardening (Trivy, penetration testing), chaos testing, load testing
- Advanced QA (90%+ coverage), full Playwright suites, performance p95 targets
- Feature extras: pagination, CSV export, advanced search, real-time HTMX updates

MVP Deliverables (2-week target):
Week 1
- Repo skeleton, Docker Compose with Postgres, minimal service stubs
- Auth service: user model, registration, login, admin bootstrap
- Basic unit tests for auth happy path

Week 2
- Order service: create order, list user orders, admin approve/reject
- Web gateway: simple pages for register/login/create order/list/approve
- One end-to-end smoke test and short demo script

Demo Acceptance Criteria (MVP):
- `docker compose up` boots all services and demo runs within ~5 minutes on a dev laptop
- Happy-path (register→login→create order→admin approve) completes end-to-end locally
- Basic smoke tests pass; linting runs on CI (optional)

Notes:
- The existing full Implementation Plan remains in this document as the "Backlog / Extended" roadmap. Teams should explicitly mark tasks as "Backlog" when using the MVP mode.
- If you want, I can now: (A) add a `docker-compose.mvp.yml` and minimal service stubs, (B) mark backlog items in the tracker automatically.

## Third-party Reviews — Summary & Action Items

Summary:
- Review 1 (balanced): Documents are strong, granular, and testable; recommends adding CI early, PR/code-review gates, parallelization of work, clearer "definition of done", and de-scoping rules for demo readiness.
- Review 2 (pragmatic): Documents are over-engineered for a demo—recommends a tight MVP, aggressive de-scope, and a 1–2 week fast-track with a focus on the happy path.

Combined, actionable changes (prioritized):
1. CI & Automation (High): Add a concrete task in Phase 1 to set up a CI pipeline (lint, tests, build). This prevents regressions as multiple contributors work in parallel.
2. PR / Code Review Gate (High): Require PR reviews and a short PR checklist for all "Critical" tasks before marking them done.
3. Parallel Tracks (High): Update Phase sequencing to allow backend API contracts + UI stubs to proceed in parallel after core infra is available.
4. Fast-track MVP (High): Add a 2-week "Demo Fast-Track" option that targets the happy path only (register → login → create order → approve). Mark many existing tasks as "Backlog / Optional" for demo mode.
5. De-scope / Parking Lot (Medium): Add explicit criteria to cut non-essential tasks (pagination, load testing, chaos testing) from the demo path if deadlines slip.
6. Weekly Demos & Final Dry Run (High): Add a weekly demo/drill task to validate end-to-end flow and stakeholder feedback; add a final stakeholder dry run in Phase 6.
7. Team & Estimates Clarification (High): Add a short section to document expected team size (e.g., 1–2 devs or 3+ devs), and show alternate timelines for single-contributor vs small team.
8. Contingency for infra/vendor issues (Medium): Add a short contingency plan for Docker/Valkey/Alpine compatibility problems and a fallback single-container mode.

How this changes the plan (minimal edits, actionable):
- Phase 1: insert a CI setup task and PR gating in the first week (precedes most other tasks).
- Phases 2–4: allow API contract stubs and UI prototyping to run in parallel; flag expensive QA and hardening tasks as "Demo-Optional / Backlog".
- Phase 5: split QA into "Demo QA" (happy-path smoke tests + one E2E drill) and "Prod QA" (full security/perf) — keep "Prod QA" as an optional later phase.

Next step: if you want, I can (A) insert the CI task and PR-gate tasks into the tracker automatically, and (B) add a concise 2-week fast-track checklist to both files. Tell me which option to apply and I'll edit the files accordingly.
